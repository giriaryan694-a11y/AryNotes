## 🏛️ Project History

At first, this project was called **LocalNotes**.  
But during development, I discovered that *LocalNotes* is already the name of an existing company/tool. To avoid any legal or trademark issues, I decided to rename the project to **AryNotes** — a unique and personal name. ✅

The **idea** came after seeing how **Duck.ai** stores its chats only in the browser, without any server. That inspired me to create a similar privacy-first **notes app**, where notes are saved only on the user’s device.
